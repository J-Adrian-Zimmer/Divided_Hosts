The `get` Subdir
----------------

This is the root of the directory tree for your static files.  

If
you run `serveYOS.py` from the `install` subdir these are the files
that will be served.  

If you run an `install...` from that directory, these are the static
files that will be installed at NearlyFreeSpeech or Firebase.
